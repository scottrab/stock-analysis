## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the total daily trading volume and daily returns for green energy stocks in 2017-2018.

## Results
As seen from the PNG images attached, the code took just over one second to run for 2017 and 2018.  This differs from the module's code where the code ran in less than half a second. 

## Summary
While refactoring code in this case could lead to more efficiency, however,  I did not see improved run times for the code. To run the analysis on additional stocks, arrays would need to be altered.  To run an analysis on a group of different stocks, the script would need to be reworked and re-written to be more efficent and applicable across more stocks.
